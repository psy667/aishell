# AI Shell

This project implements an AI-powered command line interface using node.js. Here's how it works:

1. The user types in a command.
2. The AI processes the command and executes system commands accordingly.
3. The output of these commands is shown to the user.

## Setup
To run this project, ensure you have node.js installed and then run:

```
npm install

```

After installing the dependencies, you can start the AI shell by running:

```
node aishell.js

```

Enjoy interacting with AI through the command line!
